COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL, Excel, and Tableau. The process begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to gain initial insights and clean the data. SQL queries are then used to extract relevant data, which is organized and transformed in Excel. The cleaned and structured data is then imported into Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that highlight key trends and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The repository includes SQL scripts for data extraction and analysis, Excel files for data management, and Tableau workbooks for visualizations. To use this project, you need SQL database software, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau. Clone the repository, import the SQL scripts to your database, review the Excel files for data preparation, and open the Tableau workbooks to explore the visualizations. This project leverages the strengths of SQL for data analysis, Excel for data transformation, and Tableau for data visualization to provide comprehensive insights into the pandemic.
